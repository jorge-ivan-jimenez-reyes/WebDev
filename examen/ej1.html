              Internet Research refers to the study of online behavior and the
              use of computer-based tools to analyze human behavior. It allows
              researchers to access a larger amount of data and study
              participants from different continents. However, the online world
              also has its hidden areas, making it a complex terrain for
              studying new forms of human behavior.

              Another useful distinction to be drawn here is between the
              Internet as a source of data and the Internet as a social field of
              study. Internet research is concerned not only with the study of
              on-line behavior (what people do in virtual and mediated
              environments), but is also concerned with using computer-based
              tools and computer-accessible populations to study human behavior
              in general. On the one hand, then, Internet researchers can access
              if not potentially infinite data, at least a larger amount of data
              than is possible in the physical world.

              Although Internet technology is changing fast, the focus of
              computer-mediated communications has been primarily on text-based
              virtual realities, because a majority of studies reflect the fact
              that only text-based technology is available on-line. Such a
              technological limitation, rather than being a communication
              handicap, is an imagination-enhancing challenge. It seems
              reasonable to suppose that in certain situations, people will
              prefer textual interactions, even when more advanced technology
              becomes widely available in the future.

              Internet measurement does raise some ethical issues. A pressing
              problem in Internet research is privacy; researching as an
              unobtrusive observer and collecting data, for example, inevitably
              poses a major ethical problem. Neither can this problem be avoided
              ad hoc, by using laboratory experiments, because those involve a
              small number of consenting people.

            <p>
              A different approach can be taken regarding the protection of
              privacy for data collected in virtual communities. As stated
              previously, in CMCs, the classical boundaries between public and
              private disappear; the interviewer is given data that are not
              about the participants' physical world, but rather about their
              on-line self-representation.

            <p>
              To sum up, the Internet does not appear, generally, to be a new or
              discipline-challenging research ground for social measurement,
              although virtual communities do represent an exciting exception.
